# Side-Projects-For-Fun

The purpose is to draw conclusions or analyses in order to utilize better decision-making or analyses based on facts pulled from the datasets.  

The datasets are going to be varied from different websites that is given. 

It will consist of different programming languages.

This repository consists of data that analyzes on the following:

Affordable Care Act 
  
  To perform analyses on which US states that are uninsured during the years of 2010 and 2015.
  
Education Data
 
 Performing data analyses in order to determine which gender performs well, takes advantage of resources, making predictions on which
  courses are the most common, and utilize models to predict which one is more accurate based on decision trees, SVM, or confusion matrix.
  
Fake News
  
  Used both Python and R to determine the analyses on Fake News in order to predict which type of news it is by running the decision 
  tree model in R. The analyses is also done in Python to generate the accuracy of the random forest model. 
  
Global Land Temperatures in Oakland and San Francisco
 
 Used R to predict the differences with the temperatures around these two cities in comparision to the given data back in the early
  history. The analyses involved with converting the latitude and longitude, graphing the average monthly temperature on a celsius
  perspective, uncertainty between today and 100 years ago, and creating a random forest model for both cities.
  
UCI Machine Learning Repositories
 
 Performed basic analyses on both the Iris and Glass datasets that are given from the webiste in order to make better predictions on 
  flower length and classifying the material of glass.
  
NFL Draft
 
 Utilized R to predict the performance of draft picks over the last 30 years in order to see which rounds and picks that has performed
  the best in their careers. The analysis is done according to the information on the Quarterback, and Running Backs at that time.
